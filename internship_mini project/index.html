		<p><br><br><br><br><br><br><br>Tesla's mission is to accelerate the world's transition to sustainable energy. 
			Tesla was founded in 2003 by a group of engineers who wanted to prove that people didn't
			 need to compromise to drive electric – 
			that electric vehicles can be better, quicker and more fun to drive than gasoline cars."You have to match the convenience of the gasoline car in order for people to buy an electric car." "In order to have clean air in cities, you have to go electric." "You should not show somebody something very cool and then not do it. At Tesla, any prototype that is shown to customers, the production must be better."</p>

					 <h2 class="h-secondary center">Model X</h2><br>
					 <p class="center">--Starting price: $83,190 / £81,990<br>
						--Availability: US, UK, and Europe<br><br>
						Tesla's Model X is the <b>"soccer mom's"</b> answer to the electric car.<br> It's an SUV-style EV capable of seating seven people, but owes a lot of its design to the Model S, especially with that interior display.<br>
						
						It uniquely features rear Falcon Wing doors (think the Delorean in Back to the Future) that, along with the huge touchscreen inside, will make all your kids think you bought a car from the future. <br>There are two models, but three different seating configurations - you can choose 5 (included), 6 ($6,500 extra), or 7 ($3,500 extra).<br> Autopilot is included, the full self-driving upgrade option is $10,000/£6,800.<br>
						
						<br>Long Range: AWD, 360 miles, 0-62mph in 3.8 seconds<br>
						Plaid: AWD, 305 miles, 0-62mph in 2.5s<br>
						As with the Tesla Model S, there are a number of different versions of the Model X as Tesla has realigned the model naming, with a 75D becoming Long Range, and the 100D and P100D shifting into the Performance line.

					 <h2 class="h-secondary center">Roadster</h2><br>
					 <p class="center">
						--Starting price: $200,000, <br>
						--reservations open
						--Availability: 2020<br><br>
						The Tesla Roadster started the whole thing in 2008 - and was due to return in 2020<br> (it's been reviewed by some US sources, but otherwise is still only up for reservations only).<br>
						
						The Roadster's aim is to be the fastest electric car on the road,<br> with some impressive figures announced so far, with a 0-60mph speed of 1.9 seconds and a top speed over 250mph.<br> It will seat four and has a removable glass roof.<br>
						
						There are two versions up for reservation:<br> the Roadster and the Founders Series, with a $50k difference in price between the two.<br>
						1.Roadster: AWD, 620 miles, 0-60mph in 1.9 seconds<br>
						2.Semi:
						The Tesla Semi is exactly what it sounds like: a Semi-trailer truck. A prototype debuted in late 2017 and was planned for production in 2020 - but it hasn't officially surfaced yet.<br>
						
						Tesla initially claimed the truck would have a 500-mile range on a full charge and<br> would be able to run for 400 miles after an 80 per cent charge in 30 minutes using new <b>"Tesla Megacharger" </b>charging stations.<br>
						
						Musk said the Semi would come standard with Tesla Autopilot, allowing semi-autonomous driving on highways.

					 <h2 class="h-secondary center">Tesla Model 3</h2><br>
					 <p class="center">
						--Starting price: $30,190<br>
						--Availability: US, UK and Europe<br><br>
						
						The Model 3 launched in the US in 2016 as the affordable alternative to the Model S,<br> with prices having dropped to make it the most affordable Tesla.<br>
						
						A four-door sedan, the Model 3 launched with a range of options, but that's been refined to just three that are currently available.<br> Ranges are based on combined figures. Autopilot is standard, but the full self-driving upgrade is $10,000/£6,800.<br>
						
						Standard Range Plus: RWD, 263 miles, 0-62mph in 5.3 seconds, partial premium interior<br>
						Long Range: AWD, 353 miles, 75kWh, 0-60mph in 4.4s, premium interior<br>
						Performance: AWD, 315 miles, 75kWh, 0-60mph in 3.2s, premium interior<br>
						All models offer Autopilot as standard -<br> which brings a range of driver assistance - <br>but there's the option for the full self-driving upgrade at $10,000 (£6,800), which adds navigation to Autopilot, <br>self-parking, Smart Summon, traffic light recognition and automatic city street driving<br>Forthcoming for 2021 is automatic driving on city streets and Enhanced Summon - where your parked car will come find you in a car park.
